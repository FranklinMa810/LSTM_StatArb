# LSTM_StatArb

This is a test ground for new ideas applying statistical learning in stat arb to mainly addresses the issues:
1. Co-integration is tested based on historical data, thus does not work in special market regime, e.g. 2020 under COVID-19;
2. Is there any way to "stat arb" the pair that did not show co-integration if vol/mean-reversion trend can be well estimated; 
3. If the estimation is better than OLS or Garch, it can be regarded as a new way to calibrate OH process or Auto-reg model
